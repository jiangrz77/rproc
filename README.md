This is the initial version for abundance fitting of r-process elements, used in An Actinide-boost Star Discovered in the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (DOI 10.3847/2041-8213/adc8a3).\
R-process nucleosynthesis yields are compiled from different literature from multiple astrophysical sites, including NSM, MDRSN etc.\
The code is not in maintanence.
